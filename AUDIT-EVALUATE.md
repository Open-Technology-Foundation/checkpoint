## Purpose and Functionality

Checkpoint is a specialized backup and snapshot utility designed for developers, system administrators, and DevOps engineers who need reliable point-in-time snapshots of code and configuration directories. It serves as a safety net during development by preserving complete directory states before making significant changes, with capabilities to compare and restore these states when needed.

### Core Features

- **Smart Backups**: Creates organized, timestamped directory backups with optional descriptive suffixes
- **Metadata System**: Attaches descriptions, tags, and system information to checkpoints
- **Powerful Comparison**: Visualizes differences between current files and checkpoints or between checkpoints
- **Flexible Restoration**: Supports full or selective restoration with various options
- **Remote Operations**: Handles secure remote backup creation and restoration via SSH
- **Space Efficiency**: Uses hardlinking between versions to minimize disk usage
- **Cross-Platform**: Works consistently across Linux and macOS/BSD systems

The utility is particularly valuable for development safety, system configuration management, experimentation phases, and as a complement to traditional version control systems.
