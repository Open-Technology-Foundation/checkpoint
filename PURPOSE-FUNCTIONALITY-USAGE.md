## Functionality & Capabilities (The "What" & "How")

### Key Features

#### 1. **Smart Backup Creation** (`checkpoint.sh:main()` - lines 1380-1828)
Creates timestamped snapshots with intelligent exclusion patterns and optional metadata attachment.

```bash
# Basic checkpoint with automatic timestamp
checkpoint

# Checkpoint with descriptive suffix and metadata
checkpoint -s "pre-api-refactor" --desc "Before major API changes" --tag "version=2.1.0"
```

**Technical Implementation:**
- Uses `rsync` with archive mode (`-a`) to preserve permissions, ownership, and timestamps
- Implements cross-platform path resolution via `get_canonical_path()` function
- Automatically excludes temporary files/directories (`.gudang/`, `tmp/`, `*~`, etc.)
- Supports custom exclusion patterns for project-specific needs

#### 2. **Visual Difference Comparison** (`checkpoint.sh:compare_files()` - lines 524-714)
Provides sophisticated comparison capabilities between current state and checkpoints or between different checkpoints.

```bash
# Compare current files with latest checkpoint
checkpoint --restore --diff

# Compare two specific checkpoints with detailed output
checkpoint --from 20250430_091429 --compare-with 20250430_101530 --detailed

# Compare only JavaScript files between states
checkpoint --restore --diff --files "*.js"
```

**Technical Implementation:**
- Intelligent diff tool selection: `delta` > `colordiff` > standard `diff`
- Statistical reporting (identical files, differences, unique files)
- Pattern-based filtering for targeted comparisons
- Enhanced output formatting with color coding

#### 3. **Flexible Restoration System** (`checkpoint.sh:restore_backup()` - lines 916-1077)
Supports complete directory restoration or selective file recovery with preview capabilities.

```bash
# Full restoration with confirmation
checkpoint --restore --from 20250430_091429

# Selective restoration with preview
checkpoint --restore --files "*.config" --dry-run

# Restore to alternate location
checkpoint --restore --to ~/restored-project
```

**Technical Implementation:**
- `rsync`-based restoration preserving file attributes
- Pattern-based inclusion/exclusion for selective recovery
- Dry-run mode for safe preview of changes
- Interactive confirmation with timeout safeguards

#### 4. **Metadata Management System** (`checkpoint.sh:create_metadata()` - lines 1081-1116)
Attaches searchable descriptions, tags, and system information to checkpoints.

```bash
# Create checkpoint with metadata
checkpoint --desc "Release candidate" --tag "version=1.0.0" --tag "status=testing"

# Search checkpoints by metadata
checkpoint --metadata --find "version=1.0.0"

# Update existing checkpoint metadata
checkpoint --metadata --update 20250430_091429 --set "status=approved"
```

**Technical Implementation:**
- Key-value metadata storage in `.metadata` files
- Pattern-based search across all checkpoints
- Metadata update capabilities for existing checkpoints

#### 5. **Remote Operations via SSH** (`checkpoint.sh:remote_create_backup()` - lines 1895-1965)
Enables checkpoint creation and restoration across network boundaries with security hardening.

```bash
# Create checkpoint on remote server
checkpoint --remote user@host:/path/to/backups

# Restore from remote checkpoint
checkpoint --remote user@host:/path/to/backups --restore --from 20250430_091429
```

**Technical Implementation:**
- Hardened SSH configurations with security best practices
- Connection validation before operations
- Secure `rsync` over SSH with proper authentication
- Timeout protection for network operations

#### 6. **Storage Optimization** (`checkpoint.sh:main()` - lines 1787-1794)
Minimizes disk usage through hardlinking and intelligent backup rotation.

```bash
# Enable hardlinking for space efficiency
checkpoint --hardlink

# Automatic rotation: keep only 5 most recent
checkpoint --keep 5

# Age-based rotation: remove backups older than 30 days
checkpoint --age 30
```

**Technical Implementation:**
- Uses `hardlink` utility when available for space deduplication
- Configurable rotation policies by count or age
- Automatic pruning with safety validation
